Hereâ€™s a concise, step-by-step summary of the key prompting techniques from OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4.1 Prompting Guide, along with explanations for why each technique is effective:

---

### ðŸ”¹ 1. Agentic Workflows

**What:** Design prompts that enable the model to act as an autonomous agent, capable of planning, using tools, and persisting through multi-turn tasks.

**Why:** GPT-4.1 excels in agentic tasks when guided properly. Including reminders about persistence, tool usage, and planning transforms the model from a passive responder to an active problem-solver.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. System Prompt Reminders

**What:** Incorporate specific instructions in the system prompt to guide the model's behavior:

* **Persistence:** Instruct the model to continue until the task is fully resolved.

* **Tool-Calling:** Encourage the model to utilize available tools instead of guessing.

* **Planning:** Prompt the model to plan before acting and reflect after actions.

**Why:** These reminders help the model maintain context, make informed decisions, and avoid premature conclusions, leading to more accurate and reliable outputs.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. Tool Calls

**What:** Use the `tools` parameter in the API to define available tools, rather than embedding tool descriptions directly in the prompt.

**Why:** This approach keeps the model's behavior within its training distribution, reducing errors and improving performance during tool-using tasks.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 4. Clear and Specific Instructions

**What:** Provide unambiguous and detailed instructions in your prompts.

**Why:** GPT-4.1 follows instructions more literally than previous models. Clear directives ensure the model's responses align closely with user expectations.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 5. Prompt Migration

**What:** Adapt existing prompts to align with GPT-4.1's behavior, which may differ from earlier models.

**Why:** Due to GPT-4.1's heightened sensitivity to prompt phrasing, migrating and refining prompts ensures optimal performance and desired outcomes.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 6. Iterative Prompting

**What:** Engage in a process of prompt refinement by testing and adjusting prompts based on model outputs.

**Why:** Prompt engineering is empirical. Iterative refinement helps in honing prompts to achieve the best possible results for specific tasks.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 7. Use of Examples

**What:** Include examples of desired inputs and outputs within the prompt.

**Why:** Providing examples helps the model understand the expected format and content, leading to more accurate and contextually appropriate responses.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 8. Inducing Planning via Prompting

**What:** Encourage the model to outline a plan or thought process before arriving at an answer.

**Why:** Prompting the model to plan enhances its reasoning capabilities, leading to more coherent and logically structured outputs.

By applying these techniques, you can effectively leverage GPT-4.1's capabilities for a wide range of tasks.
