In the **OpenAI Agents SDK**, **hooks** are special mechanisms that allow you to **intercept, monitor, or modify behavior** during different phases of the **agent or runner lifecycle**.

## üîÅ What Are Hooks?

Hooks in the OpenAI Agents SDK are **callback functions** that run at specific points in the **agent‚Äôs lifecycle** or **runner‚Äôs lifecycle**. They help you:

* Log or trace events
* Debug agent behavior
* Modify agent inputs or outputs
* Collect metrics or performance data
* Implement custom logic at key execution steps

## üß† Types of Hooks

Hooks are typically grouped into two categories:

### 1. **Runner Lifecycle Hooks**

These run at different stages of the **Runner** execution lifecycle.

| Hook Name       | Purpose                                                                |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `on_run_start`  | Called when the runner starts execution.                               |
| `on_run_end`    | Called when the runner ends (successfully or otherwise).               |
| `on_tool_start` | Called right before a tool function is executed.                       |
| `on_tool_end`   | Called right after the tool function completes.                        |
| `on_handoff`    | Called when control is handed off to another agent.                    |
| `on_error`      | Called when any error occurs in the loop (tool, message, handoff, etc) |

---

### 2. **Agent Lifecycle Hooks**

These are triggered during agent-specific behaviors like generating messages, choosing tools, etc.

| Hook Name              | Purpose                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `on_agent_start`       | Called when the agent starts its processing.                            |
| `on_message_generated` | Called when the agent generates a message.                              |
| `on_tool_call`         | Called when the agent chooses to use a tool.                            |
| `on_agent_end`         | Called when the agent finishes its turn (before next input or handoff). |

## üß∞ Example: Adding a Hook

Here‚Äôs how you add hooks in the OpenAI Agents SDK:

```python
from openai import Runner

def log_run_start(context):
    print("üé¨ Runner started")
    print("User Input:", context.input)

def log_tool_usage(context, tool_call):
    print("üõ†Ô∏è Tool is being used:", tool_call.tool_name)

runner = Runner(
    agent=my_agent,
    hooks={
        "on_run_start": log_run_start,
        "on_tool_start": log_tool_usage
    }
)

runner.run_sync("Tell me a joke.")
```

## üí° Why Are Hooks Important?

Hooks are powerful for:

* **Monitoring** agent behavior in production
* **Debugging** complex workflows
* **Logging or telemetry** for agent performance
* **Customizing** behavior without modifying core logic

## üìù Summary

| Concept          | Description                                                             |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hook**         | A callback function triggered during agent or runner execution          |
| **Runner Hooks** | Applied to `Runner` lifecycle (e.g., `on_run_start`, `on_tool_start`)   |
| **Agent Hooks**  | Applied to agent actions (e.g., `on_message_generated`, `on_tool_call`) |
| **Use Cases**    | Debugging, logging, metrics, behavioral tuning                          |
